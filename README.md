# -estimation-of-the-thermal-efficiency-of-a-chiller
This project was developed through the course of model identification and data analysis of the university of Pavia.
The goal was the estimation of the thermal efficiency of a chiller through its coefficient of performance. 
To estimate it we used polynomial models, stepwise regression and neural networks.
